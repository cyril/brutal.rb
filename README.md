> A _code-first_ approach to automate the writing of unit tests.

## Intro

[![I Hate Tests](https://github.com/fixrb/brutal/raw/master/img/rubyhack-2019-ruby3-what-s-missing-by-yukihiro-matsumoto.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmOt9HhszCI?start=1732&end=1736 "I don't like tests. It's not DRY.")

## Purpose

Let __Brutal__ shape for you the actual behavior of your code against as many combinations of challenges as needed.

Without giving the power to test everything, it makes it easy to generate in no time a set of tests for all relevant contexts.

By delegating to __Brutal__ this repetitive (and redundant) job of writing tests, you'll be able to focus on your core business: writing code.

## Warning

__Brutal__ does not prevent from bugs.
As a picture of the behavior of the code, generated tests would be wrong if the code is wrong.

This is why it is important to carefully read a generated test suite, to ensure that it describes the behavior of the code as it is supposed to behave.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'brutal'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install brutal

## Quick Start

Just type `brutal` in a Ruby project's folder and watch the magic happen.

## Usage

__Brutal__'s configuration file is `.brutal.yml`, which acts like a meta-spec.
This YAML file can contains the following keys:

* `header` (optional): Some code to execute before the test suite.
* `front_object` (required): The front object of the test suite.
* `subject` (required): The object of each context.
* `variables` (required): A hash to generate the subject of each context.
* `actual_values` (required): A list of tests to challenge the subject.

### Behavioral integrity

In versioned projects, the integrity of the behavior of the code could easily be checked by executing `brutal` after changes.
If something goes wrong, `git diff test.rb` can show it.

Example of regression from [The Greeter class](https://github.com/fixrb/brutal/raw/master/examples/the_greeter_class/):

```diff
  require './greeter'

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  front_object = Greeter

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  actual = front_object.new('world')

- raise unless actual.salute == "Hello World!"
+ raise unless actual.salute == "Hello !"
```

### Optional parameters

It would also be possible to ask for an RSpec template by passing "`rspec`" argument:

```sh
brutal rspec
```

## Example

Given this config file:

```yaml
---
front_object: |
  "Hello "

subject: |
  %{front_object} + %{string}

variables:
  string:
    - "'Alice'"
    - "'Bob'"

actual_values:
  - "%{subject}.to_s"
  - "%{subject}.length"
```

The `brutal` command would generate and write in to a `test.rb` file the following "Plain Old Ruby":

```ruby
front_object = "Hello "

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

actual = front_object + 'Alice'

raise unless actual.to_s == "Hello Alice"
raise unless actual.length == 11

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

actual = front_object + 'Bob'

raise unless actual.to_s == "Hello Bob"
raise unless actual.length == 9
```

And the `brutal rspec` command would generate and write in to a `test_spec.rb` file the following spec:

```ruby
RSpec.describe do
  let(:front_object) { "Hello " }

  context do
    let(:actual) { front_object + 'Alice' }

    it { expect(actual.to_s).to eq("Hello Alice") }
    it { expect(actual.length).to eq(11) }
  end

  context do
    let(:actual) { front_object + 'Bob' }

    it { expect(actual.to_s).to eq("Hello Bob") }
    it { expect(actual.length).to eq(9) }
  end
end
```

## Rake integration example

A generated `test.rb` file could be matched as follows:

```ruby
Rake::TestTask.new do |t|
  t.pattern = 'test.rb'
end
```
